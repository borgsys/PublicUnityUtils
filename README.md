# Public Utils for Unity from borgsys

These custom utils are provided AS IS. 
No promises on functionality or safety are made, they are only used for a specfic purpose, tested on a single specific system and version and not updated for general use. 
Shared as ideas for further personal customization.

Some are workarounds/hacks where the API is missing. 
Some chunks of code are sourced from generative AI or from tests on custom code uploaded and analyzed by generative AI and then re-customized.
