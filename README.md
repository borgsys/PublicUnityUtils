# Public Unity Utils from borgsys

These custom Unity utils are provided AS IS. 
No promises on functionality are made, they are only tested on a single specific system and version and not updated for general use. 
Published as ideas and for further personal customization.

Some are workarounds/hacks where the API is missing. 
Some chunks of code are sourced from AI or from tests on custom code uploaded and analyzed by AI and then re-customized. 

Have fun!
